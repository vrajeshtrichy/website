# AI-ML Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with UnityML - Hummingbirds

## Overview

This project is a multi-agent reinforcement learning environment built using Unity ML-Agents. It simulates the behavior of hummingbirds in a dynamic environment, where they learn to collect nectar from flowers through reinforcement learning.

### Features

- **Multi-Agent Environment**: Train multiple hummingbird agents to collect nectar simultaneously.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Agents use reinforcement learning techniques to learn how to maximize nectar collection.
- **Dynamic Environment**: The environment includes dynamic elements like moving flowers and competing agents.
- **UI Integration**: A user-friendly UI provides information on game progress, including nectar collection and game time.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Unity 3D](https://unity.com/)
- [Unity ML-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/vrajeshtrichy/AI-ML-MultiAgentRL-UnityML-Hummingbirds.git
   cd AI-ML-MultiAgentRL-UnityML-Hummingbirds
   ```

2. Open the project in Unity.

3. Set up Python and the ML-Agents Toolkit. Refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/main/docs/Installation.md) for detailed instructions.

4. Train the agents or play the game as per your preference.

## Usage

- **Training**: To train the agents using reinforcement learning, follow the training instructions in the Unity ML-Agents Toolkit documentation.

- **Gameplay**: You can also play the game by controlling a hummingbird agent using keyboard inputs. Refer to the in-game instructions for controls.
