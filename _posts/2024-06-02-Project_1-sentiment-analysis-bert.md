# IMDB Reviews Sentiment Analysis using Transformers (BERT)

This project is an example of sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset using Transformers and BERT.

## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook project demonstrates text classification for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset. It uses Transformers and the BERT model for natural language processing.

## Setup

Before running the code, you need to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install transformers[sentencepiece] datasets
```

## Overview of the IMDB Dataset

The IMDB dataset contains movie reviews labeled as positive or negative sentiments. This section provides an overview of the dataset, including data visualization.

## Tokenizer

We use a tokenizer to preprocess the text data before feeding it into the model.

## Tiny IMDB

For demonstration purposes, a smaller subset of the IMDB dataset, referred to as "Tiny IMDB," is used to fine-tune the model.

## Training Run

The model is trained on the Tiny IMDB dataset and evaluated. You can also perform your own training run on the full IMDB dataset by following the instructions in the notebook.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vrajeshtrichy/AI-ML-NLP-SentimentAnalysis.git
cd AI-ML-NLP-SentimentAnalysis/IMDB-ReviewsSentimentAnalysis-using-Transformers-BERT
```

2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Setup" section.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `IMDB_text_classification.ipynb` for detailed code and analysis.

4. Follow the notebook's instructions to run and experiment with the code.
