description:  This notebook walks you through building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered by Elasticsearch (ES) and Hugging Face models, letting you toggle between ES-vectorising (your ES cluster vectorises for you when ingesting and querying) vs self-vectorising (you vectorise all your data before sending it to ES).

## Data sourcing and preparation

The data utilised is sourced from Hugging Face datasets, specifically the
[MongoDB/whatscooking.restaurants dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MongoDB/whatscooking.restaurants).

Embedding model from HuggingFace: [thenlper/gte-small](https://huggingface.co/thenlper/gte-small)

GPT Model from OpenAI: [OpenAI /gpt-4o-mini](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini)


## Perform Vector Search on User Queries

If `USE_ELASTICSEARCH_VECTORISATION` is true, the text query is sent directly to ES where the uploaded model will be used to vectorise it first before doing a vector search. If `USE_ELASTICSEARCH_VECTORISATION` is false, then we do the vectorising locally before sending a query with the vectorised form of the query.
